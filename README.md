#  Stable Diffusion: Text-to-Image Generation Notebook

This notebook demonstrates how to generate **photorealistic images from text prompts** using the **Stable Diffusion model**. It leverages the `diffusers` library from Hugging Face and is intended for use on machines equipped with **NVIDIA GPUs (‚â•10GB VRAM)**.

---

##  Features

- Generate images from text prompts with high realism
- Customize prompts for different artistic or photographic styles
- Uses the `StableDiffusionPipeline` from Hugging Face
- Compatible with Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, and VS Code

---

##  Dependencies

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install diffusers transformers accelerate safetensors
```
---

## Example Prompt

Try this for a photorealistic result:

```text
"A panoramic view of an old Moroccan town, with narrow cobbled streets, traditional terracotta buildings, minarets and ornate old doors, under a clear, luminous blue sky, with a calm, historic atmosphere"
```

---

##  Output

The generated image is displayed inline using `IPython.display`, and can also be saved using `image.save("filename.png")`.

---

## Model Info

- **Base Model**: `CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4`
- **Text Encoder**: CLIP ViT-L/14 (frozen)
- **UNet Size**: 860M parameters
- **Trained On**: Subset of [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/)

##  Tips

- Use detailed prompts with styles like `DSLR`, `ultra realistic`, `natural lighting`, etc.
- Run on GPU-enabled environments for best performance.
- Add `pipe.to("cuda")` to move model to GPU.
